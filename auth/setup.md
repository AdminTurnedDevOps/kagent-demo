To access kagent enterprise, an OIDC solution must be configured for autentication.

You can use common identity providers like:
- Google
- Okta
- Auth0
- Keycloak

For the purposes of a demo, you can use keycloak locally.

1. Deploy keycloak on k8s: `keycloak-demo.yaml`
2. Go through `keycloakSetup.md`
