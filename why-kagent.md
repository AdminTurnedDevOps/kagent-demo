kagent in a nutshell

* Agents that specifically run on Kubernetes
* A method of building Agents ON Kubernetes
* Specific CRDs/Operators to manage it all on Kubernetes
* It's like an Agent of sorts that's always running and looking at your environment to help for specific use cases (e.g - a Pod is down)
* It has a chatbot feature so you can ask questions about your environment

The goal is to be able to have a dedicated set of Agents that can call out to various LLMs and MCP Servers to assist you within your Kubernetes environments.
